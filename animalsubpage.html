<h1> ANIMAL WASTE</h1>
<li>
<br>Farm animal waste comes from livestock, poultry, and dairy production. It can be manure from farm animals or the byproducts 
of meat processing.It can also be the waste byproduct from inland fish farm aquaculture. Animal waste from meat processing includes
 hair, blood, feathers, skin, bone, hides, beaks, fat, and fluids. Animal waste can contain organic matter, disease-causing organisms,
 and odors.It can also contain bacteria and nitrates, which can contaminate drinking water and cause human illnesses.</br>

<br>Farmers frequently use animal waste as fertilizer and apply it to the soil. If too much animal waste is applied,
 or if it is applied incorrectly, it can pollute lakes and streams, contaminate ground water, and harm human health. </br>

<br>Pits of animal manure are commonplace on a farm and are useful for cleanup and storage of waste. However,
 if not properly maintained and ventilated, these pits of animal manure can generate four potentially
 deadly gases: ammonia, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and methane. As manure decays and ferments, 
 it creates these gases and can cause toxic reactions in people or animals, oxygen depletion, asphyxiation, and even death.
 The gases can also cause explosions. It can also contain bacteria and nitrates, which can contaminate drinking water 
 and cause human illnesses.</br>
