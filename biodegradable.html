<h1> BIODEGRADABLE WASTE</h1>
<li><br>Biodegradable waste includes any organic matter in waste which can be broken down into carbon dioxide, water, methane or simple organic molecules by 
micro-organisms and other living things using composting, aerobic digestion, anaerobic digestion or similar processes. In waste management, it also includes 
some inorganic materials which can be decomposed by bacteria. Such materials include gypsum and its products such as plasterboard and other simple organic
 sulfates which can be decomposed to yield hydrogen sulfide in anaerobic land-fill conditions.</br>

<br>In domestic waste collection, the scope of biodegradable waste may be narrowed to include only those degradable wastes capable of being handled in the local
 waste handling facilities.</br>

<h4>Sources</h4>
<br>Biodegradable waste can be commonly found in municipal solid waste (sometimes called biodegradable municipal waste, or BMW) as green waste, food waste,
 paper waste, and biodegradable plastics. Other biodegradable wastes include human waste, manure, sewage, sewage sludge and slaughterhouse waste. 
 In the absence of oxygen, much of this waste will decay to methane by anaerobic digestion.</br>

<br>In many parts of the developed world, biodegradable waste is separated from the rest of the waste stream, either by separate kerb-side collection or by 
waste sorting after collection. At the point of collection such waste is often referred to as Green waste. Removing such waste from the rest of the 
waste stream substantially reduces waste volumes for disposal and also allows biodegradable waste to be composted where composting facilities exist.</br>

<h4>Uses of biodegradable waste</h4>
<br>Biodegradable waste can be used for composting or a resource for heat, electricity and fuel by means of incineration or anaerobic digestion. Swiss Kompogas 
and the Danish AIKAN process are examples of anaerobic digestion of biodegradable waste. While incineration can recover the most energy, anaerobic 
digestion plants retain the nutrients and compost for the soil and still recover some of the contained energy in the form of biogas. Kompogas produced
 27 million Kwh of electricity and biogas in 2009. The oldest of the company's own lorries has achieved 1,000,000 kilometers driven with biogas from household
 waste in the last 15 years.</br>

<h4>Areas relying on organic waste</h4>
<br>Featured in an edition of The Economist that predicted events in 2014, it was revealed that Massachusetts creates roughly 1.4 million tons of organic waste 
every year. Massachusetts, along with Connecticut and Vermont, are also going to enact laws to divert food waste from landfills.</br>

<br>In small and densely populated states, landfill capacity is limited so disposal costs are higher . Decomposing food waste generates methane, a notorious 
greenhouse gas. However, this biogas can be captured and turned into energy through anaerobic digestion, and then sold into the electricity grid.</br>

<br>Anaerobic digestion grew in Europe, but is starting to develop in America. Massachusetts is increasing its production of anaerobic digesters.</br>



<h4>Climate change impacts</h4>
<br>The main environmental threat from biodegradable waste is the production of methane and other greenhouse gases.</br>
