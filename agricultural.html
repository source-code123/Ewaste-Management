<h1> AGRICULTURAL WASTE</h1>
<li><br>Agricultural waste is waste produced as a result of various agricultural operations.
 It includes manure and other wastes from farms, poultry houses and slaughterhouses;
 harvest waste; fertilizer run- off from fields; pesticides that enter into water, air or soils;
 and salt and silt drained from fields.</br>
 
 <h4>CAUSES OF AGRICULATURAL WASTE</h4>
 <br>Contaminated Water: Contaminated water used for irrigation is one further source of pollution. ... The process of agricultural pollution becomes harder to 
 fight when such water poisons the livestock and causes crop failure. 3. Soil Erosion and Sedimentation: Further problems are caused by soil erosion and
 sedimentation.</br>
 
 <h4>What is agricultural waste management system?</h4>
 
<br> Specific biohazards that are related to agricultural waste include fungi, molds, bacteria, and viruses, including animal borne diseases (zoonoses).
 Removal of waste products such as manure from animal and poultry houses can potentially expose workers to agricultural dusts, resulting in respiratory problems, 
 such as occupational asthma. Exposure to waste-containing pesticides and other agrochemicals poses additional risks. Personal protective equipment (PPE) and
 personal respiratory equipment (PRE) can protect workers from many types of exposure.</br>
<br>Many agricultural wastes are economically productive resources. Agricultural slurry, for example, can be converted to fertilizer.
 This incentivizes waste storage as an economic activity. Safety hazards involved in waste storage include exposure to environments containing carbon dioxide 
 (CO2), ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and methane gas. At unsafe levels these gases can be toxic, flammable, and potentially explosive. Waste storage environments
 may also produce low-oxygen environments that can endanger workers who enter without proper protection.</br>
<br>Employers have a duty to provide employees with the equipment and training necessary for safely handling agricultural wastes. Workplaces are required to have
 first aid supplies available for treating injuries on-site and plans for addressing accidents or spills involving agricultural waste. Workplace risk is also
 reduced via requirements for a minimum safe distance between worker camps and environments containing agricultural waste</br>
<br>Agricultural wastes as a hazardous material is addressed as part of the Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS) for Farmers.
Agricultural waste, which includes both natural (organic) and non-natural wastes, is a general term used to describe waste produced on a farm through various
 farming activities. These activities can include but are not limited to dairy farming, horticulture, seed growing, livestock breeding, grazing land, market 
 gardens, nursery plots, and even woodlands.</br> 
 <br> Agricultural and food industry residues, refuse and wastes constitute a significant proportion of world wide 
 agricultural productivity. It has variously been estimated that these wastes can account for over 30% of world wide agricultural productivity. The boundaries
 to accommodate agricultural waste derived from animal agriculture and farming activities are identified in this book. Examples will be provided of how animal 
 agriculture and various practices adopted at farm-scale impact on the environment. When discharged to the environment, agricultural wastes can be both 
 beneficial and detrimental to living matter and the book will therefore also address the pros and cons of waste derived from animal agriculture in todayâ€™s 
 environment. Given agricultural wastes are not restricted to a particular location, but rather are distributed widely, their effect on natural resources such 
 as surface and ground waters, soil and crops, as well as human health, will also be addressed.</br>
<br>Selection of soils with properties that favor waste management can help to prevent environmental damage. Tables AWM-1 and AWM-2 show the degree and kind of
 soil limitations affecting the treatment of agricultural waste, including municipal and food-processing wastewater and effluent from lagoons or storage ponds.</br>
