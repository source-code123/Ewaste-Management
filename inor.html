<h4>What is inorganic garbage</h4>
<br>Waste is composed of all those waste resulting from products and materials that we use in our daily activities, while, when not already provide that 
utility discards them is throwing them in a container specially intended for this purpose. But it should be noted that not all what we call junk presents 
the same origin and such question is that there is a classification that is closely linked with the impact that can have on direct contact with human beings
 and the environment.</br>
<br>For example, inorganic trash, that is which will occupy us, will be all that waste that does not have a biological origin, i.e., not derived from a living
 organism but comes from the industrial environment or is the result of some unnatural process. The industrial products like for example bottles, plastics,
 among others, are an example of this type of waste.</br>
<br>It also integrates this group of those materials sanitary waste from disposal. Thus, all the elements that are used in hospitals or health care facilities
 such as: cottons, bandages, gauzes, needles, among the most recurrent, are considered inorganic garbage.
And then, as the rest of this type of waste should be carefully evacuated, in closed bags, separated for example organic waste and if possible with a legend 
identifying to prevent future tampering and therefore its indiscriminate dissemination, which in many cases turns out to be highly dangerous due to pollution
 and the risk to health that entails</br>.
<br>The essential feature and making it a type of care waste, is that the inorganic garbage does not degrade from natural means and it takes a lot of time to do so.
It is very important that people take awareness of the importance of sorting waste not only to avoid the dangerous waste affecting our quality of life, but 
also to recycle that garbage that Yes can be re-used for raw materials, such is the case of organic waste (comes from living organisms).</br>
