<h1> RADIOACTIVE WASTE</h1>
<li>
<br>Radioactive waste is waste that contains radioactive material. Radioactive waste is usually a by-product of nuclear power generation and 
other applications of 
nuclear fission or nuclear technology, such as research and medicine. 
Radioactive waste is hazardous to all forms of life and the environment, and is regulated by 
government agencies in order to protect human health and the environment.<br>

<br>Radioactivity naturally decays over time, so radioactive waste has to be isolated and confined in appropriate disposal facilities for a sufficient period until it
 no longer poses a threat. 
 The time radioactive waste must be stored for depends on the type of waste and radioactive isotopes.
 Current approaches to managing 
 radioactive waste have been segregation and storage for short-lived waste, near-surface disposal for low and some intermediate level waste,
 and deep burial or 
 partitioning / transmutation for the high-level waste<br>

<br>A summary of the amounts of radioactive waste and management approaches for most developed countries are presented and
 reviewed periodically as part of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management.
The radioactivity of all radioactive waste weakens with time.
 All radionuclides contained in the waste have a half-life—the time it takes for half of the atoms to decay into another
 nuclide—and eventually, all radioactive waste decays into non-radioactive elements (i.e., stable nuclides).
 Certain radioactive elements (such as plutonium-239) will remain hazardous to humans and other creatures for 
 hundreds of thousands of years. Other radionuclides remain hazardous for millions of years. Thus, these wastes must 
 be shielded for centuries and isolated from the living environment for millennia.
 Since radioactive decay follows the half-life rule, the rate of decay is inversely 
 proportional to the duration of decay. In other words, the radiation from a long-lived isotope like iodine-129 
 will be much less intense than that of a short-lived isotope like iodine-131. The two tables show some of the major radioisotopes, 
 their half-lives, and their radiation yield as a proportion of the yield of fission of uranium-235</br>

<br>The 
energy and the type of the ionizing radiation emitted by a radioactive substance are also important factors in determining its threat to humans.</br>

 <br>The chemical properties of the radioactive element will 
 how mobile the substance is and how likely it is to spread into the environment and contaminate humans.
 This is further complicated by the fact that many radioisotopes do not decay immediately to a stable state but
 rather to radioactive decay products within a decay chain before ultimately reaching a stable state.</br>

<br>Exposure to radioactive waste may cause serious harm or death. In humans, a dose of 1 sievert carries a 5.5% risk of developing cancer, and regulatory 
agencies assume the risk is linearly proportional to dose even for low doses. Ionizing radiation causes deletions in chromosomes. If a developing organism 
such as an fetus is irradiated, it is possible a birth defect may be induced, but it is unlikely this defect will be in a gamete or a gamete-forming cell. The 
incidence of radiation-induced mutations in humans is small, as in most mammals, because of natural cellular-repair mechanisms, many just now coming to light. 
These mechanisms range from DNA, mRNA and protein repair, to internal lysosomic digestion of defective proteins, and even induced cell suicide—apoptosis</br>

<br>Depending on the decay mode and the pharmacokinetics of an element (how the body processes it and how quickly), the threat due to exposure to a given activity 
of a radioisotope will differ. For instance iodine-131 is a short-lived beta and gamma emitter, but because it concentrates in the thyroid gland, it is more able
 to cause injury than caesium-137 which, being water soluble, is rapidly excreted through urine. In a similar way, the alpha emitting actinides and radium are 
 considered very harmful as they tend to have long biological half-lives and their radiation has a high relative biological effectiveness, making it far more 
 damaging to tissues per amount of energy deposited. Because of such differences, the rules determining biological injury differ widely according to the 
 radioisotope, time of exposure and sometimes also the nature of the chemical compound which contains the radioisotope.</br>

<h4>Sources</h4>
<br>Radioactive waste comes from a number of sources. In countries with nuclear power plants, nuclear armament, or nuclear fuel treatment plants, the majority of 
waste originates from the nuclear fuel cycle and nuclear weapons reprocessing. Other sources include medical and industrial wastes, as well as naturally 
occurring radioactive materials (NORM) that can be concentrated as a result of the processing or consumption of coal, oil and gas, and some minerals, as
 discussed below.</br>

<br>Nuclear fuel cycle
Main articles: Nuclear fuel cycle and Spent nuclear fuel
See also: Nuclear power
Front end
Waste from the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle is usually alpha-emitting waste from the extraction of uranium. It often contains radium and its decay 
products</br>

<br>Uranium dioxide (UO2) concentrate from mining is a thousand or so times as radioactive as the granite used in buildings. It is refined from yellowcake (U3O8), 
then converted to uranium hexafluoride gas (UF6). As a gas, it undergoes enrichment to increase the U-235 content from 0.7% to about 4.4% (LEU). It is then 
turned into a hard ceramic oxide (UO2) for assembly as reactor fuel elements.</br>

The main by-product of enrichment is depleted uranium (DU), principally the U-238 isotope, with a U-235 content of ~0.3%. It is stored, either as UF6 or as U3O8. Some is used in applications where its extremely high density makes it valuable such as anti-tank shells, and on at least one occasion even a sailboat keel.[15] It is also used with plutonium for making mixed oxide fuel (MOX) and to dilute, or downblend, highly enriched uranium from weapons stockpiles which is now being redirected to become reactor fuel.

<br>Back end
See also: Nuclear reprocessing
The back-end of the nuclear fuel cycle, mostly spent fuel rods, contains fission products that emit beta and gamma radiation, and actinides that emit alpha 
particles, such as uranium-234 (half-life 245 thousand years), neptunium-237 (2.144 million years), plutonium-238 (87.7 years) and americium-241 (432 years), 
and even sometimes some neutron emitters such as californium (half-life of 898 years for Cf-251). These isotopes are formed in nuclear reactors.</br>

<br>It is important to distinguish the processing of uranium to make fuel from the reprocessing of used fuel. Used fuel contains the highly radioactive products of 
fission (see high level waste below). Many of these are neutron absorbers, called neutron poisons in this context.
 These eventually build up to a level where 
they absorb so many neutrons that the chain reaction stops, even with the control rods completely removed. 
At that point the fuel has to be replaced in the 
reactor with fresh fuel, even though there is still a substantial quantity of uranium-235 and plutonium present. In the United States,
 this used fuel is usually 
"stored", while in other countries such as Russia, the United Kingdom, France,
 Japan and India, the fuel is reprocessed to remove the fission products,
 and the 
fuel can then be re-used.
 The fission products removed from the fuel are a concentrated form of high-level waste as are the chemicals used in the process. 
While these countries reprocess the fuel carrying out single plutonium cycles, India is the only country known to be planning multiple plutonium recycling 
schemes.</br>

<br>Fuel composition and long term radioactivity
See also: Spent nuclear fuel and High level waste
Main article: Long-lived fission product</br>


<br>Activity of U-233 for three fuel types. In the case of MOX, the U-233 increases for the first 650 thousand years as it is 
produced by decay of Np-237 which was 
created in the reactor by absorption of neutrons by U-235.</br>

<br>Total activity for three fuel types. In region 1 we have radiation from short-lived nuclides, and in region 2 from Sr-90 and Cs-137. On the far right we see the
 decay of Np-237 and U-233.
The use of different fuels in nuclear reactors results in different spent nuclear fuel (SNF) composition, with varying activity curves.</br>

<br>Long-lived radioactive waste from the back end of the fuel cycle is especially relevant when designing a complete waste management plan for SNF. When looking at 
long-term radioactive decay, the actinides in the SNF have a significant influence due to their characteristically long half-lives. Depending on what a nuclear 
reactor is fueled with, the actinide composition in the SNF will be different.</br>

<br>An example of this effect is the use of nuclear fuels with thorium. Th-232 is a fertile material that can undergo a neutron capture reaction and two beta minus
 decays, resulting in the production of fissile U-233.
 The SNF of a cycle with thorium will contain U-233. Its radioactive decay will strongly influence the 
 long-term activity curve of the SNF around a million years. A comparison of the activity associated to U-233 for three different SNF types can be seen in the
 figure on the top right. The burnt fuels are thorium with reactor-grade plutonium (RGPu), thorium with weapons-grade plutonium (WGPu) and Mixed Oxide fuel 
 (MOX, no thorium). For RGPu and WGPu, the initial amount of U-233 and its decay around a million years can be seen. This has an effect in the total activity 
 curve of the three fuel types. The initial absence of U-233 and its daughter products in the MOX fuel results in a lower activity in region 3 of the figure on 
 the bottom right, whereas for RGPu and WGPu the curve is maintained higher due to the presence of U-233 that has not fully decayed. Nuclear reprocessing can 
 remove the actinides from the spent fuel so they can be used or destroyed (see Long-lived fission product#Actinides).<?br>

<br>Proliferation concerns</br>
<br>
Since uranium and plutonium are nuclear weapons materials, there have been proliferation concerns. Ordinarily (in spent nuclear fuel), plutonium is reactor-grade
 plutonium. In addition to plutonium-239, which is highly suitable for building nuclear weapons, it contains large amounts of undesirable contaminants: 
 plutonium-240, plutonium-241, and plutonium-238. These isotopes are extremely difficult to separate, and more cost-effective ways of obtaining fissile material
 exist (e.g. uranium enrichment or dedicated plutonium production reactors).</br>

<br>High-level waste is full of highly radioactive fission products, most of which are relatively short-lived. This is a concern since if the waste is stored, 
perhaps in deep geological storage, over many years the fission products decay, decreasing the radioactivity of the waste and making the plutonium easier to 
access. The undesirable contaminant Pu-240 decays faster than the Pu-239, and thus the quality of the bomb material increases with time (although its quantity 
decreases during that time as well). Thus, some have argued, as time passes, these deep storage areas have the potential to become "plutonium mines", from which
 material for nuclear weapons can be acquired with relatively little difficulty. Critics of the latter idea have pointed out the difficulty of recovering useful 
 material from sealed deep storage areas makes other methods preferable. Specifically, the high radioactivity and heat (80 C in surrounding rock) greatly 
 increases the difficulty of mining a storage area, and the enrichment methods required have high capital costs.</br>

<br>Pu-239 decays to U-235 which is suitable for weapons and which has a very long half-life (roughly 109 years). Thus plutonium may decay and leave uranium-235. 
However, modern reactors are only moderately enriched with U-235 relative to U-238, so the U-238 continues to serve as a denaturation agent for any U-235 
produced by plutonium decay.

One solution to this problem is to recycle the plutonium and use it as a fuel e.g. in fast reactors. In pyrometallurgical fast reactors, the separated plutonium 
and uranium are contaminated by actinides and cannot be used for nuclear weapons.</br>

<br>Nuclear weapons decommissioning
Waste from nuclear weapons decommissioning is unlikely to contain much beta or gamma activity other than tritium and americium. It is more likely to contain 
alpha-emitting actinides such as Pu-239 which is a fissile material used in bombs, plus some material with much higher specific activities, such as Pu-238 or Po.

In the past the neutron trigger for an atomic bomb tended to be beryllium and a high activity alpha emitter such as polonium; an alternative to polonium is 
Pu-238. For reasons of national security, details of the design of modern bombs are normally not released to the open literature.

Some designs might contain a radioisotope thermoelectric generator using Pu-238 to provide a long lasting source of electrical power for the electronics in the 
device.

<br>It is likely that the fissile material of an old bomb which is due for refitting will contain decay products of the plutonium isotopes used in it, these are 
likely to include U-236 from Pu-240 impurities, plus some U-235 from decay of the Pu-239; due to the relatively long half-life of these Pu isotopes, 
these wastes from radioactive decay of bomb core material would be very small, and in any case, far less dangerous (even in terms of simple radioactivity) 
than the Pu-239 itself.</br>

<br>The beta decay of Pu-241 forms Am-241; the in-growth of americium is likely to be a greater problem than the decay of Pu-239 and Pu-240 as the americium is a 
gamma emitter (increasing external-exposure to workers) and is an alpha emitter which can cause the generation of heat. The plutonium could be separated from 
the americium by several different processes; these would include pyrochemical processes and aqueous/organic solvent extraction. A truncated PUREX type 
extraction process would be one possible method of making the separation. Naturally occurring uranium is not fissile because it contains 99.3% of U-238 and only
 0.7% of U-235.</br>

<br>Legacy waste
Due to historic activities typically related to radium industry, uranium mining, and military programs, numerous sites contain or are contaminated with 
radioactivity. In the United States alone, the Department of Energy states there are "millions of gallons of radioactive waste" as well as "thousands of tons of
 spent nuclear fuel and material" and also "huge quantities of contaminated soil and water." Despite copious quantities of waste, the DOE has stated a goal 
 of cleaning all presently contaminated sites successfully by 2025.The Fernald, Ohio site for example had "31 million pounds of uranium product", "2.5 
 billion pounds of waste", "2.75 million cubic yards of contaminated soil and debris", and a "223 acre portion of the underlying Great Miami Aquifer had uranium 
 levels above drinking standards." The United States has at least 108 sites designated as areas that are contaminated and unusable, sometimes many thousands 
 of acres. DOE wishes to clean or mitigate many or all by 2025, using the recently developed method of geomelting,[citation needed] however the task can
 be difficult and it acknowledges that some may never be completely remediated. In just one of these 108 larger designations, Oak Ridge National Laboratory,
 there were for example at least "167 known contaminant release sites" in one of the three subdivisions of the 37,000-acre (150 km2) site. Some of the U.S. 
 sites were smaller in nature, however, cleanup issues were simpler to address, and DOE has successfully completed cleanup, or at least closure, 
 of several sites<br>

<h4>Medicine</h4>
<br>Radioactive medical waste tends to contain beta particle and gamma ray emitters. It can be divided into two main classes. In diagnostic nuclear medicine a number
 of short-lived gamma emitters such as technetium-99m are used. Many of these can be disposed of by leaving it to decay for a short time before disposal as normal
 waste. Other isotopes used in medicine, with half-lives in parentheses, include:</br>

<li>Y-90, used for treating lymphoma (2.7 days)</li>
<li>I-131, used for thyroid function tests and for treating thyroid cancer (8.0 days)</li>
<li>Sr-89, used for treating bone cancer, intravenous injection (52 days)</li>
<li>Ir-192, used for brachytherapy (74 days)</li>
<li>Co-60, used for brachytherapy and external radiotherapy (5.3 years)</li>
<li>Cs-137, used for brachytherapy, external radiotherapy (30 years)</li>
<h4>Industry</h4>
<br>Industrial source waste can contain alpha, beta, neutron or gamma emitters. Gamma emitters are used in radiography while neutron emitting sources are used in a 
range of applications, such as oil well logging.</br>

<br>Naturally occurring radioactive material</br>

<br>Annual release of uranium and thorium radioisotopes from coal combustion, predicted by ORNL to cumulatively amount to 2.9 million tons over the 1937–2040 period, from the combustion of an estimated 637 billion tons of coal worldwide.[23]
Substances containing natural radioactivity are known as NORM (Naturally occurring radioactive material). After human processing that exposes or concentrates 
this natural radioactivity (such as mining bringing coal to the surface or burning it to produce concentrated ash), it becomes technologically enhanced naturally
 occurring radioactive material (TENORM).[24] A lot of this waste is alpha particle-emitting matter from the decay chains of uranium and thorium. The main source
 of radiation in the human body is potassium-40 (40K), typically 17 milligrams in the body at a time and 0.4 milligrams/day intake. Most rocks, due to their 
 components, have a low level of radioactivity. Usually ranging from 1 millisievert (mSv) to 13 mSv annually depending on location, average radiation exposure 
 from natural radioisotopes is 2.0 mSv per person a year worldwide.[26] This makes up the majority of typical total dosage (with mean annual exposure from other 
 sources amounting to 0.6 mSv from medical tests averaged over the whole populace, 0.4 mSv from cosmic rays, 0.005 mSv from the legacy of past atmospheric 
 nuclear testing, 0.005 mSv occupational exposure, 0.002 mSv from the Chernobyl disaster, and 0.0002 mSv from the nuclear fuel cycle).</br>

<br>TENORM is not regulated as restrictively as nuclear reactor waste, though there are no significant differences in the radiological risks of these materials.</br>

Coal
Coal contains a small amount of radioactive uranium, barium, thorium and potassium, but, in the case of pure coal, this is significantly less than the average 
concentration of those elements in the Earth's crust. The surrounding strata, if shale or mudstone, often contain slightly more than average and this may also 
be reflected in the ash content of 'dirty' coals.[23][28] The more active ash minerals become concentrated in the fly ash precisely because they do not burn well.
[23] The radioactivity of fly ash is about the same as black shale and is less than phosphate rocks, but is more of a concern because a small amount of the fly 
ash ends up in the atmosphere where it can be inhaled.[29] According to U.S. NCRP reports, population exposure from 1000-MWe power plants amounts to 490 person-
rem/year for coal power plants, 100 times as great as nuclear power plants (4.8 person-rem/year). (The exposure from the complete nuclear fuel cycle from mining
 to waste disposal is 136 person-rem/year; the corresponding value for coal use from mining to waste disposal is "probably unknown".)

Oil and gas
Residues from the oil and gas industry often contain radium and its decay products. The sulfate scale from an oil well can be very radium rich, while the water, 
oil and gas from a well often contain radon. The radon decays to form solid radioisotopes which form coatings on the inside of pipework. In an oil processing 
plant the area of the plant where propane is processed is often one of the more contaminated areas of the plant as radon has a similar boiling point to propane.

Classification
Classifications of radioactive waste varies by country. The IAEA, which publishes the Radioactive Waste Safety Standards (RADWASS), also plays a significant 
role.

Mill tailings
Main article: Uranium tailings

Removal of very low-level waste
Uranium tailings are waste by-product materials left over from the rough processing of uranium-bearing ore. They are not significantly radioactive. Mill tailings
 are sometimes referred to as 11(e)2 wastes, from the section of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 that defines them. Uranium mill tailings typically also contain 
 chemically hazardous heavy metal such as lead and arsenic. Vast mounds of uranium mill tailings are left at many old mining sites, especially in Colorado, 
 New Mexico, and Utah.

See also: Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action
Although mill tailings are not very radioactive, they have long half-lives. Mill tailings often contain radium, thorium and trace amounts of uranium.

Low-level waste
Low level waste (LLW) is generated from hospitals and industry, as well as the nuclear fuel cycle. Low-level wastes include paper, rags, tools, clothing, filters,
ther materials which contain small amounts of mostly short-lived radioactivity. Materials that originate from any region of an Active Area are commonly 
designated as LLW as a precautionary measure even if there is only a remote possibility of being contaminated with radioactive materials. Such LLW typically 
exhibits no higher radioactivity than one would expect from the same material disposed of in a non-active area, such as a normal office block.

Some high-activity LLW requires shielding during handling and transport but most LLW is suitable for shallow land burial. To reduce its volume, it is often 
compacted or incinerated before disposal. Low-level waste is divided into four classes: class A, class B, class C, and Greater Than Class C (GTCC).

Intermediate-level waste

Spent fuel flasks are transported by railway in the United Kingdom. Each flask is constructed of 14 in (360 mm) thick solid steel and weighs in excess of 50 tons
Intermediate-level waste (ILW) contains higher amounts of radioactivity and in general require shielding, but not cooling.[33] Intermediate-level wastes includes
 resins, chemical sludge and metal nuclear fuel cladding, as well as contaminated materials from reactor decommissioning. It may be solidified in concrete or 
 bitumen for disposal. As a general rule, short-lived waste (mainly non-fuel materials from reactors) is buried in shallow repositories, while long-lived waste 
 (from fuel and fuel reprocessing) is deposited in geological repository. U.S. regulations do not define this category of waste; the term is used in Europe and 
 elsewhere.

High-level waste
High-level waste (HLW) is produced by nuclear reactors. The exact definition of HLW differs internationally. After a nuclear fuel rod serves one fuel cycle and 
is removed from the core, it is considered HLW.[34] Fuel rods contain fission products and transuranic elements generated in the reactor core. Spent fuel is 
highly radioactive and often hot. HLW accounts for over 95 percent of the total radioactivity produced in the process of nuclear electricity generation. The 
amount of HLW worldwide is currently increasing by about 12,000 metric tons every year, which is the equivalent to about 100 double-decker buses or a two-story 
structure with a footprint the size of a basketball court.[35] A 1000-MW nuclear power plant produces about 27 tonnes of spent nuclear fuel (unreprocessed) 
every year.[36] In 2010, there was very roughly estimated to be stored some 250,000 tons of nuclear HLW,[37] that does not include amounts that have escaped 
into the environment from accidents or tests. Japan estimated to hold 17,000 tons of HLW in storage in 2015.HLW have been shipped to other countries to be 
stored or reprocessed, and in some cases, shipped back as active fuel.

The radioactive waste from spent fuel rods consist primarily of cesium-137 and strontium-90, but it may also include plutonium, which can be considered a 
transuranic waste.[32] The half-lives of these radioactive elements can differ quite extremely. Some elements, such as cesium-137 and strontium-90 have half-
lives
 of approximately 30 years. Meanwhile, plutonium has a half-life of that can stretch to as long as 24,000 years.

The ongoing controversy over high-level radioactive waste disposal is a major constraint on the nuclear power’s global expansion.[39] Most scientists agree that
 the main proposed long-term solution is deep geological burial, either in a mine or a deep borehole. However, almost six decades after commercial nuclear energy
 began, no government has succeeded in opening such a repository for civilian high-level nuclear waste,[39] although Finland is in the advanced stage of the 
 construction of such facility, the Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository. Reprocessing or recycling spent nuclear fuel options already available or under active
 development still generate waste and so are not a total solution, but can reduce the sheer quantity of waste, and there are many such active programs worldwide.
 Deep geological burial remains the only responsible way to deal with high-level nuclear waste.[41] The Morris Operation is currently the only de facto high-
 level radioactive waste storage site in the United States.

<br>Transuranic waste
Globe icon.
The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with the United States and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject. You may improve this 
article, discuss the issue on the talk page, or create a new article, as appropriate. (November 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)
Transuranic waste (TRUW) as defined by U.S. regulations is, without regard to form or origin, waste that is contaminated with alpha-emitting transuranic 
radionuclides with half-lives greater than 20 years and concentrations greater than 100 nCi/g (3.7 MBq/kg), excluding high-level waste. Elements that have an 
atomic number greater than uranium are called transuranic ("beyond uranium"). Because of their long half-lives, TRUW is disposed more cautiously than either 
low- or intermediate-level waste. In the U.S., it arises mainly from weapons production, and consists of clothing, tools, rags, residues, debris and other items
 contaminated with small amounts of radioactive elements (mainly plutonium).</br>

<br>Under U.S. law, transuranic waste is further categorized into "contact-handled" (CH) and "remote-handled" (RH) on the basis of the radiation dose rate measured 
at the surface of the waste container. CH TRUW has a surface dose rate not greater than 200 mrem per hour (2 mSv/h), whereas RH TRUW has a surface dose rate of
 200 mrem/h (2 mSv/h) or greater. CH TRUW does not have the very high radioactivity of high-level waste, nor its high heat generation, but RH TRUW can be highly 
 radioactive, with surface dose rates up to 1,000,000  mrem/h (10,000 mSv/h). The U.S. currently disposes of TRUW generated from military facilities at the Waste
 Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in a deep salt formation in New Mexico.</br>

<br>Prevention
A theoretical way to reduce waste accumulation is to phase out current reactors in favour of Generation IV Reactors, which output less waste per power generated.
 Fast reactors can theoretically consume some existing waste. The UK's Nuclear Decommissioning Authority published a position paper in 2014 on the progress on 
 approaches to the management of separated plutonium, which summarises the conclusions of the work that NDA shared with UK government.</br>

<h4>Management</h4>

<br>Modern medium to high level transport container for nuclear waste
See also: High-level radioactive waste management, List of nuclear waste treatment technologies, and Environmental effects of nuclear power
Of particular concern in nuclear waste management are two long-lived fission products, Tc-99 (half-life 220,000 years) and I-129 (half-life 15.7 million years),
 which dominate spent fuel radioactivity after a few thousand years. The most troublesome transuranic elements in spent fuel are Np-237 (half-life two million 
 years) and Pu-239 (half-life 24,000 years). Nuclear waste requires sophisticated treatment and management to successfully isolate it from interacting with
 the biosphere. This usually necessitates treatment, followed by a long-term management strategy involving storage, disposal or transformation of the waste into
 a non-toxic form. Governments around the world are considering a range of waste management and disposal options, though there has been limited progress 
 toward long-term waste management solutions.</br>

<h4>In second half of 20th century, several methods of disposal of radioactive waste were investigated by nuclear nations, which are :</h4>

<br>"Long term above ground storage", not implemented.
"Disposal in outer space" (for instance, inside the Sun), not implemented - as it would be currently too expensive.
"Deep borehole disposal", not implemented.
"Rock-melting", not implemented.
"Disposal at subduction zones", not implemented.
"Ocean disposal", done by the USSR, the United Kingdom,[48] Switzerland, the United States, Belgium, France, The Netherlands, Japan, Sweden, Russia, Germany,
 Italy and South Korea. (1954–93) This is no longer permitted by international agreements.</br>
<li>"Sub seabed disposal", not implemented, not permitted by international agreements.</li>
<li>"Disposal in ice sheets", rejected in Antarctic Treaty</li>
<li>"Direct injection", done by USSR and USA.</li>
<br>In the USA, waste management policy completely broke down with the ending of work on the incomplete Yucca Mountain Repository. At present there are 70 
nuclear power plant sites where spent fuel is stored. A Blue Ribbon Commission was appointed by President Obama to look into future options for this and future 
waste. A deep geological repository seems to be favored.</br>
