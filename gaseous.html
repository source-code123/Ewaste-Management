<h1> GASEOUS WASTE</h1>

<h4>Effects of Gaseous Wastes to the environment</h4>
<h5>Global Warming</h5>
<br>Global warming is the term used to describe a gradual increase in the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere and its oceans, 
a change that is believed to
 be permanently changing the Earthâ€™s climate.</br>
<h4>What is a gaseous waste?</h4>
<br>Gaseous waste is a waste product in gas form resulting from various human activities, such as manufacturing, processing, material consumption or biological
 processes.</br>
<h5>Gaseous Wastes</h5>
<br>Effects of Gaseous Wastes to our health</br>
<h5>Why is Global Warming important?</h5>
<br>Temperature increases will have significant impacts on human activities, including: where we can live, what food we can grow, how and where we can grow food,
 and where organisms we consider pests can thrive.</br>
<h5>Generation of Gaseous Waste</h5>
<br>Burning of fuels like wood, coal, and kerosene in homes
Exhaust gases emitted by motor vehicles and industries
Thermal and nuclear power plants
Fertilizers and pesticides in agriculture</br>
<br>Smoking</br>
Different kinds of Gaseous Wastes
Carbon Monoxide (CO)
Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)
Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)
Ozone (O3)</br>
<br>Particulate Matter (PM) - small particles of gas, dust or other matters including thin droplets of liquid
Sources
Carbon Monoxide
Exhaust gases from motor vehicles, inner sources including kerosene and wood stoves
Sulfur Dioxide
Thermal coal plants, oil refineries, sulfuric acid production and smelting ores containing sulfur
Nitrogen Dioxide
Motor vehicles, electric facilitates and other industrial, commercial and residential facilities combusting liquid fuels.
Ozone
Exhaust gases from vehicles and other smoke releases. Formed from other pollutants with solar light.
Particulate Matter
Diesel engines, thermal plants, industries, dust scattered by wind, wood stoves.
Global Warming
Climate Change
Sea level rise
Ozone depletion
Adverse effect to biodiversity
Impairments to the lungs, the heart, blood vessels and the nervous system.</br>
<br>Harmful air pollutants can cause other and some rarer but potentially dangerous health effects, including cancer and damages to the immune system, neurologic,
 reproductive and developmental problems. Acute exposure to certain air pollutants can cause sudden death.
Greenhouse Effect
The exchange of incoming and outgoing radiation that warms the Earth is often referred to as the greenhouse effect because a greenhouse works in much the same
way.</br>

<br>Incoming UV radiation easily passes through the glass walls of a greenhouse and is absorbed by the plants and hard surfaces inside.
 Weaker IR radiation, however,
has difficulty passing through the glass walls and is trapped inside, thus warming the greenhouse. This effect lets tropical plants thrive inside a greenhouse,
even during a cold winter.</br>

<br>A similar phenomenon takes place in a car parked outside on a cold, sunny day. Incoming solar radiation warms the car's interior, but outgoing thermal radiation
 is trapped inside the car's closed windows.</br>
