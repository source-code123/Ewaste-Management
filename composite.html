<h1> Composite WASTE</h1>
<li>
<br>nappropriately managed waste can attract rodents and insects, which can harbour gastrointestinal parasites, yellow fever, worms, 
the plague and other conditions 
for humans, and exposure to hazardous wastes, particularly when they are burned, can cause various other diseases including cancers. 
Toxic waste materials can
 contaminate surface water, groundwater, soil, and air which causes more problems for humans, other species, and ecosystems. Waste treatment and disposal
 produces significant green house gas (GHG) emissions, notably methane, which are contributing significantly to global warming.</br>

<h4>Social costs</h4>
<br>Waste management is a significant environmental justice issue. Many of the environmental burdens cited above are more often borne by marginalized groups, 
such as 
racial minorities, women, and residents of developing nations. NIMBY (not in my back yard) is the opposition of residents to a proposal for a new development 
because it is close to them. However, the need for expansion and siting of waste treatment and disposal facilities is increasing worldwide. There is now a 
growing market in the transboundary movement of waste, and although most waste that flows between countries goes between developed nations, a significant amount
 of waste is moved from developed to developing nations.</br>

<h4>Economic costs</h4>
<br>The economic costs of managing waste are high, and are often paid for by municipal governments; money can often be saved with more efficiently designed 
collection routes, modifying vehicles, and with public education. Environmental policies such as pay as you throw can reduce the cost of management and reduce 
waste quantities. Waste recovery (that is, recycling, reuse) can curb economic costs because it avoids extracting raw materials and often cuts transportation 
costs. "Economic assessment of municipal
 waste management systems – case studies using a combination of life-cycle assessment (LCA) and life-cycle costing (LCC)".
 The location of waste treatment and disposal facilities often reduces property values due to noise, dust, pollution, unsightliness, and negative stigma.
 The informal waste sector consists mostly of waste pickers who scavenge for metals, glass, plastic, textiles,
 and other materials and then trade them for a profit. This sector can significantly alter or reduce waste in a particular system,
 but other negative economic effects come with the disease, poverty, exploitation, and abuse of its workers.</br>

<h4>Resource recovery</h4>
<br>Main article: Resource recovery
Resource recovery is the retrieval of recyclable waste, which was intended for disposal, for a specific next use. It is the processing of recyclables to 
extract or recover materials and resources, or convert to energy. This process is carried out at a resource recovery facility. Resource recovery is not only 
important to the environment, but it can be cost effective by decreasing the amount of waste sent to the disposal stream, reduce the amount of space needed for 
landfills, and protect limited natural resources.</h4>

<h4>Energy recovery</h4>
<br>Energy recovery from waste is using non-recyclable waste materials and extracting from it heat, electricity, or energy through a variety of processes, including
 combustion, gasification, pyrolyzation, and anaerobic digestion. This process is referred to as waste-to-energy.</br>

<br>There are several ways to recover energy from waste. Anaerobic digestion is a naturally occurring process of decomposition where organic matter is reduced to a 
simpler chemical component in the absence of oxygen. Incineration or direct controlled burning of municipal solid waste to reduce waste and make energy.
 Secondary recovered fuel is the energy recovery from waste that cannot be reused or recycled from mechanical and biological treatment activities. Pyrolysis
 involves heating of waste, with the absence of oxygen, to high temperatures to break down any carbon content into a mixture of gaseous and liquid fuels and 
 solid residue. Gasification is the conversion of carbon rich material through high temperature with partial oxidation into a gas stream. Plasma arc 
 heating is the very high heating of municipal solid waste to temperatures ranging from 3,000-10,000 °C, where energy is released by an electrical discharge in 
 an inert atmosphere.</br>

<br>Using waste as fuel can offer important environmental benefits. It can provide a safe and cost-effective option for wastes that would normally have to be dealt 
with through disposal. It can help reduce carbon dioxide emissions by diverting energy use from fossil fuels, while also generating energy and using waste 
as fuel can reduce the methane emissions generated in landfills by averting waste from landfills.</br>

<br>There is some debate in the classification of certain biomass feedstock as wastes. Crude Tall Oil (CTO), a co-product of the pulp and papermaking process, is 
defined as a waste or residue in some European countries when in fact it is produced “on purpose” and has significant value add potential in industrial 
applications. Several companies use CTO to produce fuel, while the pine chemicals industry maximizes it as a feedstock “producing low-carbon, bio-based 
chemicals” through cascading use.</br>

<h4>Education and awareness</h4>
<br>Education and awareness in the area of waste and waste management is increasingly important from a global perspective of resource management. The Talloires 
Declaration is a declaration for sustainability concerned about the unprecedented scale and speed of environmental pollution and degradation, and the depletion 
of natural resources. Local, regional, and global air pollution; accumulation and distribution of toxic wastes; destruction and depletion of forests, soil, and 
water; depletion of the ozone layer and emission of "green house" gases threaten the survival of humans and thousands of other living species, the integrity of 
the earth and its biodiversity, the security of nations, and the heritage of future generations. Several universities have implemented the Talloires Declaration 
by establishing environmental management and waste management programs, e.g. the waste management university project. University and vocational education are 
promoted by various organizations</br>
