<h1> DOMESTIC WASTE</h1>
<li>
<br>Domestic waste is waste that is generated as a result of the ordinary day-to-day use of a domestic premise and either</br>

<br>taken from the premises by or on behalf of the person who generated the waste; or
collected by or on behalf of a local government as part of a waste collection and disposal system.
 It is not domestic waste if it is:</br>

<br>taken from domestic premises under a commercial arrangement (ie waste collected in a skip supplied by a commercial operator)
generated at domestic premises as a result of a commercial arrangement (ie. waste generated by a builder paid to perform renovations)
This type of waste would be classified as commercial waste.</br>
<br>Commercial waste can be defined as any waste generated as a result of carrying out a business, including associated lawn and
 garden clippings from normal maintenance of the business premises. Commercial waste also includes rubbish produced by your customers ie.
 food wrappers and containers. Some waste facilities do not accept commercial waste.</br>
 <br>The problem of Domestic Waste is drawing increasing attention of the people as huge garbage is lying down uncollected beside the roads,
 streets dustbins and on the ground which is causing threat to the environment as well as endangering public health.</br>

<br>This waste is generated as consequences of household activities such as the cleaning, cooking, repairing empty containers,
 packaging, huge use of plastic carry bags. Many times these waste gets mixed with biomedical waste from hospitals and clinics.
 There is no system of segregation of organic, inorganic and recyclable wastes at the household level. Door-to-door collection is
 rarely practiced community collection bins are poorly managed and are usually no more than open dumps on the roadside.</br>
<br>
The improper handling and management of Domestic Waste from households are causing adverse effect on the public at large and this
 deteriorates the environment.</br>

<br>The municipal workers are most affected people by the occupational danger (hazard) of waste handling, they suffer from illness like
 eye problems respiratory problems, gastro and skin problems. The persons who wander for collecting the discarded things for selling
 purpose through wastes also suffer from various health problems like respiratory problem from inhaling particles, infection from direct
 contact with contaminated materials which lead to headache, diarrhea, fever and cough and cold.</br>
