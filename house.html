<h1>HOUSEHOLD WASTE</h1>
<li>
<br>Household hazardous waste (HHW), sometimes called retail hazardous waste or "home generated special materials', is post-consumer waste which qualifies 
as hazardous waste when discarded. It includes household chemicals and other substances for which the owner no longer has a use, such as consumer products
 sold for home care, personal care, automotive care, pest control and other purposes. These products exhibit many of the same dangerous characteristics as
 fully regulated hazardous waste due to their potential for reactivity, ignitability, corrosivity, toxicity, or persistence. Examples include drain cleaners, 
 oil paint, motor oil, antifreeze, fuel, poisons, pesticides, herbicides and rodenticides, fluorescent lamps, lamp ballasts, smoke detectors, medical waste,
 some types of cleaning chemicals, and consumer electronics (such as televisions, computers, and cell phones).</br>

<br>Certain items such as batteries and fluorescent lamps can be returned to retail stores for disposal. The Rechargeable Battery Recycling Corporation (RBRC)
 maintains a list of battery recycling locations and your local environmental organization should have list of fluorescent lamp recycling locations. The 
 classification "household hazardous waste" has been used for decades and does not accurately reflect the larger group of materials that during the past 
 several years have become known as "household hazardous wastes". These include items such as latex paint, non-hazardous household products and other items 
 that do not generally exhibit hazardous characteristics which are routinely included in "household hazardous waste" disposal programs. The term "home generated
 special materials" more accurately identifies a broader range of items that public agencies are targeting as recyclable and/or should not be disposed of into 
 a landfill.</br>
