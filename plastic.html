<h1> PLASTIC WASTE</h1>
<li><br>Plastic pollution is the accumulation of plastic products in the environment that adversely affects wildlife, wildlife habitat, or humans.
 Plastics that act as pollutants are categorized into micro-, meso-, or macro debris, based on size.
 Plastics are inexpensive and durable, and as a result levels of plastic production by humans are high.
 However, the chemical structure of most plastics renders them resistant to many natural processes of degradation and as a result they are slow to degrade.
 Together, these two factors have led to a high prominence of plastic pollution in the environment.</br>

<br>Plastic pollution can afflict land, waterways and oceans. Living organisms, particularly marine animals, can be harmed either by mechanical effects,
 such as entanglement in plastic objects or problems related to ingestion of plastic waste, 
 or through exposure to chemicals within plastics that interfere with their physiology. 
 Humans are also affected by plastic pollution, such as through disruption of various hormonal mechanisms.</br>

<br>In the UK alone, more than 5 million tonnes of plastic are consumed each year, of which only an estimated 24% is recycled.
 The remaining 3.8 million tonnes of waste is disposed of in landfills. This large amount of plastic waste inevitably enters the environment
 , with studies suggesting that the bodies of 90% of sea birds contain plastic debris.
 In some areas there have been significant efforts to reduce the prominence of plastic pollution,
 through reducing plastic consumption and promoting plastic recycling.
 Since the 1950s, an estimated 6.3 billion tonnes of plastic has been produced, of which an estimated 9% has been recycled and another 12% 
 of plastic waste has been incinerated.</br>
 <h4>Types of plastic debris</h4>

<br>There are three major forms of plastic that contribute to plastic pollution: microplastics as well as mega- and macro-plastics.
 Mega- and micro plastics have accumulated in highest densities in the Northern Hemisphere, concentrated around urban centers and water fronts.
 Plastic can be found off the coast of some islands because of currents carrying the debris. Both mega- and macro-plastics are found in packaging, 
 footwear, and other domestic items that have been washed off of ships or discarded in landfills. Fishing-related
 items are more likely to be found around remote islands. These may also be referred to as micro-, meso-, and macro debris.</br>

<br>Plastic debris is categorized as either primary or secondary. Primary plastics are in their original form when collected. 
Examples of these would be bottle caps, cigarette butts, and microbeads.
 Secondary plastics, on the other hand, account for smaller plastics that have resulted from the degradation of primary plastics.
Microdebris
Main article: Microplastics</br>

<br>Microdebris are plastic pieces between 2 mm and 5 mm in size.
 Plastic debris that starts off as meso- or macrodebris can become microdebris through degradation and collisions that break it down into smaller pieces.
 Microdebris is more commonly referred to as nurdles.
 Nurdles are recycled to make new plastic items, but they easily end up released into the environment during production because of their small size.
 They often end up in ocean waters through rivers and streams.
 Microdebris that come from cleaning and cosmetic products are also referred to as scrubbers.
 Because microdebris and scrubbers are so small in size, filter-feeding organisms often consume them.</br>
 

<br>Primary Microplastics, a type of microdebris, known as Nurdles enter the ocean by means of spills during transportation or from land based sources. 
These micro-plastics can accumulate in the oceans and allow for the accumulation of Persistent Bio-accumulating Toxins such as DDT and PCB's which are 
hydrophobic in nature and can cause adverse health affects.</br>

<br>A 2004 study by Richard Thompson from the University of Plymouth, UK, found a great amount of microdebris on the beaches and waters in Europe,
 the Americas, Australia, Africa, and Antarctica.
 Thompson and his associates found that plastic pellets from both domestic and industrial
 sources were being broken down into much smaller plastic pieces, some having a diameter smaller than human hair.
 If not ingested, this microdebris floats instead of being absorbed into the marine environment.
 Thompson predicts there may be 300,000 plastic items/km2 of sea surface and 100,000 plastic particles/km2 of seabed.
 International pellet watch collected samples of polythene pellets from 30 beaches from 17 countries which were then
 analysed for organic micro-pollutants. It was found that pellets found on beaches in America, 
 Vietnam and southern Africa contained compounds from pesticides suggesting a high use of pesticides in the areas.
Macrodebris</br>

<br>Plastic debris is categorized as macrodebris when it is larger than 20 mm. These include items such as plastic grocery bags.
 Macrodebris are often found in ocean waters, and can have a serious impact on the native organisms. Fishing nets have been prime pollutants. 
 Even after they have been abandoned, they continue to trap marine organisms and other plastic debris. Eventually,
 these abandoned nets become too difficult to remove from the water because they become too heavy, having grown in weight up to 6 tons.
Decomposition of plastics</br>

<br>Plastics themselves contribute to approximately 10% of discarded waste.
 Many kinds of plastics exist depending on their precursors and the method for their polymerization.
 Depending on their chemical composition, plastics and resins have varying properties related to contaminant absorption and adsorption.
 Polymer degradation takes much longer as a result of haline environments and the cooling effect of the sea. 
 These factors contribute to the persistence of plastic debris in certain environments.
 Recent studies have shown that plastics in the ocean decompose faster than was once thought, 
 due to exposure to sun, rain, and other environmental conditions, resulting in the release of toxic chemicals such as bisphenol A.
 However, due to the increased volume of plastics in the ocean, decomposition has slowed down.
 The Marine Conservancy has predicted the decomposition rates of several plastic products.
 It is estimated that a foam plastic cup will take 50 years, a plastic beverage holder will take 400 years, 
 a disposable nappy will take 450 years, and fishing line will take 600 years to degrade.
Persistent organic pollutants</br>

<br>It was estimated that global production of plastics is approximately 250 mt/yr.
 Their abundance has been found to transport persistent organic pollutants, also known as POPs.
 These pollutants have been linked to an increased distribution of algae associated with red tides.</br>

Some researchers suggest that by 2050 there could be more plastic than fish in the oceans by weight.
<h4>Effects on the environment</h4>

<br>The distribution of plastic debris is highly variable as a result of certain factors such as wind and ocean currents,
 coastline geography, urban areas, and trade routes. Human population in certain areas also plays a large role in this. 
 Plastics are more likely to be found in enclosed regions such as the Caribbean. 
 It serves as a means of distribution of organisms to remote coasts that are not their native environments. 
 This could potentially increase the variability and dispersal of organisms in specific areas that are less biologically diverse.
 Plastics can also be used as vectors for chemical contaminants such as persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals.</br>
<h4>Land</h4>

<br>Chlorinated plastic can release harmful chemicals into the surrounding soil, 
which can then seep into groundwater or other surrounding water sources and also the ecosystem.
 This can cause serious harm to the species that drink the water.</br>


<br>Landfill areas contain many different types of plastics.
 In these landfills, there are many microorganisms which speed up the biodegradation of plastics. 
 The microorganisms include bacteria such as Pseudomonas, nylon-eating bacteria, and Flavobacteria.
 These bacteria break down nylon through the activity of the nylonase enzyme.
 Breakdown of biodegradable plastics releases methane, a very powerful greenhouse gas that contributes significantly to global warming.</br>


<br>In 2012, it was estimated that there was approximately 165 million tons of plastic pollution in the world's oceans.
 One type of plastic that is of concern in terms of ocean plastic pollution is nurdles.
 Nurdles are manufactured plastic pellets (a type of microplastic) used in the creation of plastic products and are often shipped via cargo ship.
 Many billions of nurdles are spilled into oceans each year, and it has been estimated that globally, around 10% of beach litter consists of nurdles.
 Plastics in oceans typically degrade within a year, but not entirely.
 In the process, toxic chemicals such as bisphenol A and polystyrene can leach into waters from some plastics.
 Polystyrene pieces and nurdles are the most common types of plastic pollution in oceans,
 and combined with plastic bags and food containers make up the majority of oceanic debris</br>

<br>One study estimated that there are more than 5 trillion plastic pieces (defined into the four classes of small microplastics,
 large microplastics, meso- and macroplastics) afloat at sea.</br>

<br>The litter that is being delivered into the oceans is toxic to marine life, and humans. The toxins that are components of plastic include diethylhexyl
phthalate, which is a toxic carcinogen, as well as lead, cadmium, and mercury.

Plankton, fish, and ultimately the human race, through the food chain, ingest these highly toxic carcinogens and chemicals. Consuming the fish that 
contain these toxins can cause an increase in cancer, immune disorders, and birth defects.

The majority of the litter near and in the ocean is made up of plastics and is a persistent pervasive source of marine pollution.According to Dr. Marcus 
Eriksen of The 5 Gyres Institute, there are 5.25 trillion particles of plastic pollution that weigh as much as 270,000 tons (2016). This plastic is taken by 
the ocean currents and accumulates in large vortexes known as ocean gyres. The majority of the gyres become pollution dumps filled with plastic.Plastic 
pollution in tap water</br>

<br>A 2017 study found that 83% of tap water samples taken around the world contained plastic pollutants.This was the first study to focus on global drinking 
water pollution with plastics,[37] and showed that with a contamination rate of 94%, tap water in the United States was the most polluted, followed by Lebanon 
and India. European countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany and France had the lowest contamination rate, though still as high as 72%.This means that 
people may be ingesting between 3,000 and 4,000 microparticles of plastic from tap water per year.The analysis found particles of more than 2.5 microns 
in size, which is 2500 times bigger than a nanometer. It is currently unclear if this contamination is affecting human health, but if the water is also found 
to contain nano-particle pollutants, there could be adverse impacts on human well-being, according to scientists associated with the study.</br>

<br>However, plastic tap water pollution remains under-studied, as are the links of how pollution transfers between humans, air, water, and soil
Effects on animals</br>

<br>Plastic pollution has the potential to poison animals, which can then adversely affect human food supplies.Plastic pollution has been described as 
being highly detrimental to large marine mammals, described in the book Introduction to Marine Biology as posing the "single greatest threat" to them.Some 
marine species, such as sea turtles, have been found to contain large proportions of plastics in their stomach.When this occurs, the animal typically
 starves, because the plastic blocks the animal's digestive tract.Marine mammals sometimes become entangled in plastic products such as nets, which can harm 
 or kill them.</br>
<h4>Entanglement</h4>
<br>Sea turtle entangled in a ghost net
Entanglement in plastic debris has been responsible for the deaths of many marine organisms, such as fish, seals, turtles, and birds. These animals get caught
 in the debris and end up suffocating or drowning. Because they are unable to untangle themselves, they also die from starvation or from their inability to 
 escape predators. Being entangled also often results in severe lacerations and ulcers. In a 2006 report known as Plastic Debris in the World's Oceans, it 
 was estimated that at least 267 different animal species have suffered from entanglement and ingestion of plastic debris.It has been estimated that over 
 400,000 marine mammals perish annually due to plastic pollution in oceans. Marine organisms get caught in discarded fishing equipment, such as ghost nets.
 Ropes and nets used to fish are often made of synthetic materials such as nylon, making fishing equipment more durable and buoyant. These organisms can also 
 get caught in circular plastic packaging materials, and if the animal continues to grow in size, the plastic can cut into their flesh. Equipment such as nets 
 can also drag along the seabed, causing damage to coral reefs.</br>
<h4>Ingestion</h4>
<h5>Marine animals</h5>

<br>Sea turtles are affected by plastic pollution. Some species are consumers of jelly fish, but often mistake plastic bags for their natural prey. This plastic
 debris can kill the sea turtle by obstructing the oesophagus.So too are whales; large amounts of plastics have been found in the stomachs of beached
 whales</br>

<br>Some of the tiniest bits of plastic are being consumed by small fish, in a part of the pelagic zone in the ocean called the Mesopelagic zone, which is 200 to 
1000 metres below the ocean surface, and completely dark. Not much is known about these fish, other than that there are many of them. They hide in the 
darkness of the ocean, avoiding predators and then swimming to the ocean's surface at night to feed.Plastics found in the stomachs of these fish were 
collected during Malaspina's circumnavigation, a research project that studies the impact of global change on the oceans.A study conducted by Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography showed that the average plastic content in the stomachs of 141 mesopelagic fish over 27 different species was 9.2%. Their estimate 
for the ingestion rate of plastic debris by these fish in the North Pacific was between 12000 and 24000 tons per year.The most popular mesopelagic fish 
is the lantern fish. It resides in the central ocean gyres, a large system of rotating ocean currents. Since lantern fish serve as a primary food source for 
the fish that consumers purchase, including tuna and swordfish, the plastics they ingest become part of the food chain. The lantern fish is one of the main 
bait fish in the ocean, and it eats large amounts of plastic fragments, which in turn will not make them nutritious enough for other fish to consume.</br>

<br>Deep sea animals have been found with plastics in their stomachs.</br>
<h5>Birds</h5>

<br>Plastic pollution does not only affect animals that live solely in oceans. Seabirds are also greatly affected. In 2004, it was estimated that gulls in the 
North Sea had an average of thirty pieces of plastic in their stomachs.Seabirds often mistake trash floating on the ocean's surface as prey. Their food 
sources often has already ingested plastic debris, thus transferring the plastic from prey to predator. Ingested trash can obstruct and physically damage a 
bird's digestive system, reducing its digestive ability and can lead to malnutrition, starvation, and death. Toxic chemicals called polychlorinated biphenyls 
(PCBs) also become concentrated on the surface of plastics at sea and are released after seabirds eat them. These chemicals can accumulate in body tissues and 
have serious lethal effects on a bird's reproductive ability, immune system, and hormone balance. Floating plastic debris can produce ulcers, infections and 
lead to death. Marine plastic pollution can even reach birds that have never been at the sea. Parents may accidentally feed their nestlings plastic, mistaking
 it for food.Seabird chicks are the most vulnerable to plastic ingestion since they can't regurgitate like the adult seabirds.</br>
