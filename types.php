	<h1>WHAT IS WASTE?</h1>
	
	What is Waste Management?
Americans alone are responsible for producing a hopping 220 million tons of waste a year. This number is far more than any other nation in the world.
 Because of this fact both the government and environmental associations have developed numerous methods of dealing with the problem.
 Waste management is that solution, a rather complex issue that encompasses more than 20 different industries Waste management is collection, 
transportation,
 and disposal of garbage, sewage and other waste products.

Waste management is the process of treating solid wastes and offers variety of solutions for recycling items that donâ€™t belong to trash.
 It is about how garbage can be used as a valuable resource. Waste management is something that each and every household and business owner in the world needs.
 Waste management disposes of the products and substances that you have use in a safe and efficient manner.


According to Wikipedia,

Waste management or Waste disposal is all the activities and actions required to manage waste from its inception to its final disposal.
 This includes amongst other things, collection, transport, treatment and disposal of waste together with monitoring and regulation. 
 It also encompasses the legal and regulatory framework that relates to waste management encompassing guidance on recycling etc.

You will find there are eight major groups of waste management methods, each of them divided into numerous categories. 
Those groups include source reduction and reuse, animal feeding, recycling, composting, fermentation, landfills, incineration and land application.
 You can start using many techniques right at home, like reduction and reuse, which works to reduce the amount of disposable material used
	
	
<h1>WASTE TYPES</h1>
Waste management or waste disposal are all the activities and actions required to manage waste from its inception to its final disposal.
 This includes amongst other things collection, transport, treatment and disposal of waste together with monitoring and regulation.
 It also encompasses the legal and regulatory framework that relates to waste management encompassing guidance on recycling.

Waste can take any form that is solid, liquid, or gas and each have different methods of disposal and management.
 Waste management normally deals with all types of waste whether it was created in forms that are industrial, biological, household,
 and special cases where it may pose a threat to human health. It is produced due to human activity such as when factories extract and process raw materials.
 Waste management is intended to reduce adverse effects of waste on health, the environment or aesthetics.

Waste management practices are not uniform among countries (developed and developing nations); regions (urban and rural areas),
 and sectors (residential and industrial).

A large portion of waste management practices deal with municipal solid waste (MSW) which is waste that is created by household, 
industrial, and commercial activity
<h3>Waste hierarchy</h3>
The waste hierarchy refers to the "3 Rs" reduce, reuse and recycle, which classify waste management
 strategies according to their desirability in terms of waste minimisation. The waste hierarchy remains the cornerstone of most waste minimisation strategies.
 The aim of the waste hierarchy is to extract the maximum practical benefits from products and to 
 generate the minimum amount of waste; see: resource recovery. The waste hierarchy is represented as a pyramid because the basic premise 
 is for policy to take action first and prevent the generation of waste. The next step or preferred action is to reduce the generation of waste i.e.
 by re-use. The next is recycling which would include composting. Following this step is material recovery and waste-to-energy.
 Energy can be recovered from processes i.e. landfill and combustion, at this level of the hierarchy. The final action is disposal,
 in landfills or through incineration without energy recovery. This last step is the final resort for waste which has not been prevented,
 diverted or recovered. The waste hierarchy represents the progression of a product or material through the sequential stages
 of the pyramid of waste management. The hierarchy represents the latter parts of the life-cycle for each product.

<h3>Life-cycle of a product</h3>
The life-cycle begins with design, then proceeds through manufacture, distribution, use and then follows through the waste hierarchy's stages of reduce, 
reuse and recycle. Each of the above stages of the life-cycle offers opportunities for policy intervention, to rethink the need for the product, 
to redesign to minimize waste potential, to extend its use. The key behind the life-cycle of a product is to
 optimize the use of the world's limited resources by avoiding the unnecessary generation of waste.

<h3>Resource efficiency</h3>
Resource efficiency reflects the understanding that current, global, economic growth and development can not be sustained with the 
current production and consumption patterns. Globally, we are extracting more resources to produce goods than the planet can replenish.
 Resource efficiency is the reduction of the environmental impact from the production and consumption of these goods, from final raw material extraction
 to last use and disposal. This process of resource efficiency can address sustainability.

An example of such a source in which we are extracting to produce more goods and causes damage to the environment is the waste of fossil fuels.
 An example of such a fossil fuel is the waste of energy. 32% of energy wasted for grains, 25.3% energy wasted in vegetables, 23.4% wasted in fruit,
 32% wasted in dairy, 16% wasted in meat, poultry, and fish, 31.4% wasted in eggs. This shows how much energy we are wasting by wasting grains,
 vegetables, fruit, dairy, meat, poultry, fish and eggs[8]. Additionally, that is just the energy associated with growing those food commodities. 
 There is also more energy associated in packaging and transporting those goods. At the end of the day, we are not using our resources efficiently 
 by wasting food. The amount of energy that is wasted in food loss is also the amount of energy taken from other sources that perhaps need it and can
 make a better use from it.

<h3>Polluter-pays principle</h3>
The polluter-pays principle is a principle where the polluting party pays for the impact caused to the environment.
 With respect to waste management, this generally refers to the requirement for a waste generator to pay for appropriate disposal 
 of the unrecoverable material.

<h3>History</h3>
Main article: History of waste management
Throughout most of history, the amount of waste generated by humans was insignificant due to low population density and low societal levels of 
the exploitation of natural resources. Common waste produced during pre-modern times was mainly ashes and human biodegradable waste, 
and these were released back into the ground locally, with minimum environmental impact. Tools made out of wood or metal
 were generally reused or passed down through the generations.

However, some civilizations do seem to have been more profligate in their waste output than others. In particular, 
the Maya of Central America had a fixed monthly ritual, in which the people of the village would gather together and burn their rubbish in large dumps.

<h3>Modern era</h3>

Sir Edwin Chadwick's 1842 report The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population was influential in securing the passage of the first 
legislation aimed at waste clearance and disposal.
Following the onset of industrialisation and the sustained urban growth of large population centres in England, the buildup of waste in the cities
 caused a rapid deterioration in levels of sanitation and the general quality of urban life. The streets became choked with filth due to the lack of
 waste clearance regulations.[10] Calls for the establishment of a municipal authority with waste removal powers occurred as early as 1751,
 when Corbyn Morris in London proposed that "... as the preservation of the health of the people is of great importance, 
 it is proposed that the cleaning of this city, should be put under one uniform public management, and all the filth be...conveyed by the Thames to 
 proper distance in the country".

However, it was not until the mid-19th century, spurred by increasingly devastating 
cholera outbreaks and the emergence of a public health debate that the first legislation on the issue emerged.
 Highly influential in this new focus was the report The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population in 1842 of the social reformer, 
 Edwin Chadwick, in which he argued for the importance of adequate waste removal and management facilities to improve the health and wellbeing of 
 the city's population.

In the UK, the Nuisance Removal and Disease Prevention Act of 1846 began what was to be a steadily evolving process of the provision
 of regulated waste management in London. The Metropolitan Board of Works was the first citywide authority that centralized sanitation 
 regulation for the rapidly expanding city and the Public Health Act 1875 made it compulsory for every household to deposit their weekly waste in 
 "moveable receptacles: for disposalâ€”the first concept for a dust-bin.


Manlove, Alliott & Co. Ltd. 1894 destructor furnace. The use of incinerators for waste disposal became popular in the late 19th century.
The dramatic increase in waste for disposal led to the creation of the first incineration plants, or, as they were then called, "destructors". 
In 1874, the first incinerator was built in Nottingham by Manlove, Alliott & Co. Ltd. to the design of Albert Fryer. However, these were met with 
opposition on account of the large amounts of ash they produced and which wafted over the neighbouring areas.

Similar municipal systems of waste disposal sprung up at the turn of the 20th century in other large cities of Europe and North America. 
In 1895, New York City became the first U.S. city with public-sector garbage management.

Early garbage removal trucks were simply open bodied dump trucks pulled by a team of horses. 
They became motorized in the early part of the 20th century and the first close body trucks to eliminate odours with a dumping lever
 mechanism were introduced in the 1920s in Britain. These were soon equipped with 'hopper mechanisms' where the scooper was loaded at
 floor level and then hoisted mechanically to deposit the waste in the truck. The Garwood Load Packer was the first truck in 1938, to incorporate 
 a hydraulic compactor.

<h3>Waste handling and transport</h3>
Main articles: Waste collection vehicle, Dustbin, and Waste sorting

Molded plastic, wheeled waste bin in Berkshire, England
Waste collection methods vary widely among different countries and regions.
 Domestic waste collection services are often provided by local government authorities, or by private companies for industrial and commercial waste.
 Some areas, especially those in less developed countries, do not have formal waste-collection systems.

<h3>Waste handling practices</h3>
Curbside collection is the most common method of disposal in most European countries,
 Canada, New Zealand and many other parts of the developed world in which waste is collected at regular intervals by specialised trucks. 
 This is often associated with curb-side waste segregation. In rural areas waste may need to be taken to a transfer station. 
 Waste collected is then transported to an appropriate disposal facility. In some areas, 
 vacuum collection is used in which waste is transported from the home or commercial premises by vacuum along small bore tubes.
 Systems are in use in Europe and North America.

<h3>Main article: Automated vacuum collection</h3>
In some jurisdictions unsegregated waste is collected at the curb-side or from waste transfer stations and then sorted into 
recyclables and unusable waste. Such systems are capable of sorting large volumes of solid waste, salvaging recyclables, and turning the rest
 into bio-gas and soil conditioner. In San Francisco, the local government established its Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance in support
 of its goal of "Zero waste by 2020", requiring everyone in the city to keep recyclables and compostables out of the landfill. The three streams 
 are collected with the curbside "Fantastic 3" bin system â€“ blue for recyclables, green for compostables, and black for landfill-bound
 materials â€“ provided to residents and businesses and serviced by San Francisco's sole refuse hauler, Recology.
 The City's "Pay-As-You-Throw" system charges customers by the volume of landfill-bound materials,
 which provides a financial incentive to separate recyclables and compostables from other discards. 
 The City's Department of the Environment's Zero Waste Program has led the City to achieve 80% diversion, 
 the highest diversion rate in North America. Other businesses such as Waste Industries use a variety of
 colors to distinguish between trash and recycling cans.

<h3>Financial models</h3>
In most developed countries, domestic waste disposal is funded from a national or local tax which may be related to income, or national house value.
 Commercial and industrial waste disposal is typically charged for as a commercial service, often as an integrated charge which includes disposal costs.
 This practice may encourage disposal contractors to opt for the cheapest disposal option such as landfill rather than the environmentally best solution
 such as re-use and recycling. In some areas such as Taipei, the city government charges its households and industries for the volume of rubbish they produce.
 Waste will only be collected by the city council if waste is disposed in government issued rubbish bags. This policy has successfully
 reduced the amount of waste the city produces and increased the recycling rate.
focused on some very persistent organic compounds such as dioxins, furans, and PAHs, which may be created and which may have serious
 environmental consequences.

<h3>Recycling</h3>
Main article: Recycling

Recycling is a resource recovery practice that refers to the collection and reuse of waste materials such as empty beverage containers.
 The materials from which the items are made can be reprocessed into new products.
 Material for recycling may be collected separately from general waste using dedicated bins and collection vehicles, 
 a procedure called kerbside collection. In some communities, the owner of the waste is required to separate the materials into different bins 
 (e.g. for paper, plastics, metals) prior to its collection. In other communities, all recyclable materials are placed in a single bin for collection,
 and the sorting is handled later at a central facility. The latter method is known as "single-stream recycling.

The most common consumer products recycled include aluminium such as beverage cans, copper such as wire, steel from food and aerosol cans, 
old steel furnishings or equipment, rubber tyres, polyethylene and PET bottles, glass bottles and jars, paperboard cartons, newspapers,
 magazines and light paper, and corrugated fiberboard boxes.

PVC, LDPE, PP, and PS (see resin identification code) are also recyclable. These items are usually composed of a single type of material, 
making them relatively easy to recycle into new products. The recycling of complex products (such as computers and electronic equipment)
 is more difficult, due to the additional dismantling and separation required.

The type of material accepted for recycling varies by city and country. Each city and country has different recycling programs
 in place that can handle the various types of recyclable materials. However, certain variation in acceptance is reflected in the resale value of the
 material once it is reprocessed. In July 2017, the Chinese government announced an import ban of 24 categories of recyclables and solid waste, 
 including plastic, textiles and mixed paper, placing tremendous impact on developed countries globally, which exported directly or indirectly to China.

Re-use
Biological reprocessing
Main articles: Composting, Home composting, Anaerobic digestion, and Microbial fuel cell

An active compost heap.
Recoverable materials that are organic in nature, such as plant material, food scraps
 and paper products, can be recovered through composting and digestion processes to decompose the organic matter.
 The resulting organic material is then recycled as mulch or compost for agricultural or landscaping purposes. In addition,
 waste gas from the process (such as methane) can be captured and used for generating electricity and heat (CHP/cogeneration) maximising efficiencies.
 The intention of biological processing in waste management is to control and accelerate the natural process of decomposition of organic matter. 
 (See resource recovery).

<h3>Energy recovery</h3>
Main article: Waste-to-energy
Energy recovery from waste is the conversion of non-recyclable waste materials into usable heat, electricity,
 or fuel through a variety of processes, including combustion, gasification, pyrolyzation, anaerobic digestion,
 and landfill gas recovery. This process is often called waste-to-energy. Energy recovery from waste is part of 
 the non-hazardous waste management hierarchy. Using energy recovery to convert non-recyclable waste materials into electricity and heat,
 generates a renewable energy source and can reduce carbon emissions by offsetting the need for energy from fossil sources as well as reduce
 methane generation from landfills.Globally, waste-to-energy accounts for 16% of waste management.

The energy content of waste products can be harnessed directly by using them as a direct combustion fuel,
 or indirectly by processing them into another type of fuel. Thermal treatment ranges from using waste as a fuel source for
 cooking or heating and the use of the gas fuel (see above), to fuel for boilers to generate steam and electricity in a turbine. 
 Pyrolysis and gasification are two related forms of thermal treatment where waste materials are heated to high temperatures with limited oxygen availability.
 The process usually occurs in a sealed vessel under high pressure. Pyrolysis of solid waste converts the material into solid, liquid and gas products.
 The liquid and gas can be burnt to produce energy or refined into other chemical products (chemical refinery). The solid residue (char) can be further 
 refined into products such as activated carbon. Gasification and advanced Plasma arc gasification are used to convert organic materials directly into a
 synthetic gas (syngas) composed of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The gas is then burnt to produce electricity and steam. An alternative to pyrolysis is
 high temperature and pressure supercritical water decomposition (hydrothermal monophasic oxidation).

<h3>
Sustainability</h3>
The management of waste is a key component in a business' ability of maintaining ISO14001 accreditation. 
Companies are encouraged to improve their environmental efficiencies each year by eliminating waste through resource recovery practices, 
which are sustainability-related activities. One way to do this is by shifting away from waste management to resource recovery practices like
 recycling materials such as glass, food scraps, paper and cardboard, plastic bottles and metal. An important market for recycled materials is the
 construction sector. Many inorganic waste streams can be used for the production of materials for construction. This includes the recycling of concrete
 and bricks, mostly used as artificial gravel. This topic was on the agenda of the International WASCON conference in Spain in June 2015 and on the
 international Conference on Green Urbanism, held in Italy 12â€“14 October 2016.

<h3>Liquid waste-management</h3>
Sewage sludge
Main article: Sewage sludge treatment
Sewage sludge is the resulting product of waste water treatment processes.
 Due to rapid urbanization, there has been an increase in municipal waste water that results 0.1â€“30.8 kg of
 sewage per population equivalent per year (kg/p.e/year). Common disposal practices of sewage sludge are incineration, composting, and landfill.

<h2>Various Methods of Waste Disposal</h2>
Although there are many methods available to dispose off waste. Lets take a look at some of the most commonly used methods that you should know about waste management.

<h4>Landfills</h4>
Throwing daily waste/garbage in the landfills is the most popularly used method of waste disposal used today. This process of waste disposal focuses attention on burying the waste in the land. Landfills are commonly found in developing countries. There is a process used that eliminates the odors and dangers of waste before it is placed into the ground. While it is true this is the most popular form of waste disposal, it is certainly far from the only procedure and one that may also bring with it an assortment of space.

This method is becoming less these days although, thanks to the lack of space available and the strong presence of methane and other landfill gases, both of which can cause numerous contamination problems. Landfills give rise to air and water pollution which severely affects the environment and can prove fatal to the lives of humans and animals. Many areas are reconsidering the use of landfills.

Incineration/Combustion
Incineration or combustion is a type disposal method in which municipal solid wastes are burned at high temperatures so as as to convert them into residue and gaseous products. The biggest advantage of this type of method is that it can reduce the volume of solid waste to 20 to 30 percent of the original volume, decreases the space they take up and reduce the stress on landfills.

This process is also known as thermal treatment where solid waste materials are converted by Incinerators into heat, gas, steam and ash.
 Incineration is something that is very in countries where landfill space is no longer available, which includes Japan.
 
<h3>Technologies</h3>
Traditionally, the waste management industry has been a late adopter of new technologies such as RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tags, GPS and integrated software packages which enable better quality data to be collected without the use of estimation
